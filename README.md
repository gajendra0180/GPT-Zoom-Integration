> # GPT-Zoom-Integration
>
> > In this project, we built a **bot** using Node.js which **joins Zoom meetings, interprets verbal input** from participants, and **responds verbally** using GPT.<br/>
> > The bot will convert the **voice input from Zoom into text, process the text** using GPT, **convert the text response back into spoken word**, and feed the response back through Zoom.
> > <br/> **The end goal is to be able to speak to GPT over Zoom.**

> # Requirements:
>
> > - _Build a bot using Node.js which enters Zooms when provided with a meeting link_.
> > - _Implement speech-to-text which converts voice input from the Zoom meeting into text_.
> > - _Pass the text into GPT_.
> > - _Implement text-to-speech which converts the GPT response into speech which is passed through Zoom_.
> >   <br/>
